• Use the same image as in Homework #2
– After removing small regions and regions with aspect ratio less than 3
– Is extracting boundary points a good thing to do?
• Use polar representation
– Use ρ = x cos θ + y sin θ 
– Decide how to quantize angle and offset
• Implement Hough Transform
– Display the parameter space image (may need to shift/stretch for better visibility)
– Is it a good thing to pre-compute the sin and cos values needed?
• Interpret the result (the parameter space image)
– Mark the peaks and point out their correspondence
– Can you tell the length of each line?
– How may you find the peaks? Is smoothing helpful?

– Why is the polar representation better than the standard y = k x + b ?
